TO DO:

Heavy:
end loop (can end game);
special enemies can attack towers, use tower spells to heal or boosts towers within range of spell;
feedback (add clear damage, make sure the user can see that the tower is doing something);


Light:
Tower targeting: Make a list and add gameobjects in order, tower will always target the one at the top of the list, when exit range or die remove self frm list.
